# GAN-TL
# Overview
This repository contains datasets used in the research paper titled "GAN-TL Domain-Adaptive Augmentation for Enhanced Transfer Learning." The datasets are designed to facilitate the reproducibility of our experiments and support further research in the domain of transfer learning and data augmentation using GANs.

# Datasets Description
# Dataset A
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Specific Dataset Name)
Type: Classification
Features: 20
Instances: 1500
Classes: 3

Description: This dataset is used for the classification task described in the paper. It has been modified to fit the required number of features and instances. Details on the modifications and feature engineering are included in the dataset_modifications folder.
# Dataset B
Source: Kaggle (Specific Dataset Name)
Type: Regression
Features: 25
Instances: 2000
Missing Values: Introduced at a rate of 5%

Description: This dataset is prepared for regression tasks with intentional missing values to test the robustness of our models. The procedure for introducing missing values is documented in the dataset_modifications folder.
# Dataset C
Type: Classification (Generated using GAN)
Features: 30
Instances: 1800
Classes: 5

Description: Dataset C is synthetically generated using a Generative Adversarial Network to simulate complex data distributions that are challenging for transfer learning models. The GAN model configurations, training procedure, and data generation scripts are available in the gan_generation folder.
